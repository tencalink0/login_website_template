# Website Login System 

## Description:
To create a simple Login System using NodeJS as a proof of concept.

## Features:
- Created with **ESModules**
- Dynamic HTML file reading
- **Sha-256** Password Encryption
- **SQLITE** integration

## Setup:
- To set the server up, you must create a **logins.db** file under the databases
folder and run **databases.init()** or visit **/clearServer** <br>
<sub><sup>Tip: I would recommend you get rid of the **/clearServer** request as anyone can access it. <br>
- To run the server, do npm run dev (in the root directory)

## Uses:
This software is unlicensed so use as you wish. I would like credit but it's up to you. 
The code has been <sub><sup>attempted</sup></sub> to be made as modular as possible.

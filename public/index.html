            <p class="main-text" >Here at BFlash, we want to find ways for you to learn for <b>free</b> but also effectively. 
                Thats why we incorporate many techniques like:
            </p>
            <ul class="main-text">
                <li>Spaced Repetition</li>
                <li>Listening Practices</li>
                <li>Reading Practices</li>
                <li>Reward Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main-text">
                But here's the better part: we're completely free! Unlike most competititors, we don't profit from this. 
                The only reason why this was created was for another method for learning languages, because unless you're 
                going to pay for an expensive language learning course, it's hard to get good at a language. <br><br>
                I spend 1 year of my life learning Turkish by myself and I got no good at the language, but 2 months into Greek
                and I could speak as well as my Turkish. This is because I only did flashcards for Turkish and didn't use these
                words in practice so I wasn't actively using them. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>So what did I learn?</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Many things. But for 1, I learn that you must balance your learning by covering all areas of that language. 
                Those being:
            </p>
            <ol class="main-text">
                <li>Listening</li>
                <li>Speaking</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Writing</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="main-text">
                Matter of fact, I have ordered these into by which I consider to be most important for claiming to "know" that 
                language. Of course, everyone will have differences but you must first identify which parts of the language 
                will be most important so your learning can be tailored towards it. <br><br>
                For this reason, we have made stage in the learning process skippable so you can tailor learning to your own
                needs. This is because we want to avoid what most apps do which is to <b>force</b> you into following their scheme
                of learning using the basis that there's "one size that fits all." <br><br>
                However, we don't leave you completely stranded by yourself with no hope. We've developed a very intelligent 
                algorithm that tests you on flashcards when it think's you're weak on them. There is also a reward system for
                those who do complete the flashcards and are rewarded with this local currency which can be spend on "upgrades."
                We also provide 100s of videos - we credit the creator - with transcripts to test yourself as you watch. These new
                words can be added into your flashcards where you can test yourself on these words.
